# Flight-Status-Power-BI-Dashboard
Built a Power BI dashboard for the FAA using data from 2M commercial flights. Loaded raw data, created a relational model, and used calculated columns and DAX measures to identify delay and cancellation patterns across airlines, airports, and causes. Final report visualizes key KPIs and breakdowns by source and carrier.
